Beryllium Source Dump from 13/8/00
All code changes over the BaseQ3 code from ID are © (c) Adam Wright
If you use this code for a project, please drop me a mail. I won't stipulate that anything you use this in must be OpenSourced, but I wouldn't mind credit where credits due.

Thanks to everyone who helped evolve this so far (all the admins out there who put up with my experimentations :), I hope to be able to take it even further. I have no plans to stop work with the release of this base.
