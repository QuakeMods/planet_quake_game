The Engineer is the true defence and support class of ETF. He is able to build Autosentries that automatically guard the team base and Supply Stations for team-mates to restock on ammunition and armour.

The Engineer is no 'pea-shooter carrying weakling' though - he's armed with a Wrench, Double-Barrelled Shotgun, high-velocity Railgun and carries both standard issue Hand Grenades and special Pulse Grenades.
