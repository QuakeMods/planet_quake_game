You *never* want to be in the cross-hairs of a good Sniper. One-shot, one-kill and it's likely that you didn't even see the muzzle flash. The sniper is by far one of the toughest classes to master, lending itself to that special breed of player with astonishing reflexes and the ability to 'make like a tree' in a split second.

Though poorly armoured, and of average speed, the sniper is armed with an annoyingly damaging Nailgun and the seriously lethal Rifle supporting both 'single-shot' and 'assault' modes of operation. He also carries both Flashbangs and standard-issue Hand Grenades.
