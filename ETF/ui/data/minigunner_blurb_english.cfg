Truly the 'Big-Daddy' of ETF. The Minigunner carries by far the largest and most aggressive of all the ETF weapons - The Minigun! If that's not trouble enough, he's also armed to the teeth with the latest in Cluster Bombs, standard-issue Hand Grenades, a Double-Barrelled Shotgun, and for last-ditch attempts at that enemy that 'just wont die' a Single-Barrelled Shotgun and an Axe!
