Hardly any offence unit is complete without the Paramedic. Moderately fast, with an excellent combination of Single-Barrelled Shotgun, Double-Barrelled Shotgun and Super-Nailgun, he's already a worthy opponent to most classes in ETF.

If you combine all that with his ability to both heal team-mates, infect enemies and perform incredible jumps using Stun Grenades, he's one hell of a great class to play. He also carries standard-issue Hand Grenades too!
