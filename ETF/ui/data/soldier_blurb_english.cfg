The backbone of any offence or defence operation, the ETF soldier has developed over time to be one of the most popular classes to play. Requiring little more than a fast-trigger finger to get going with, this class offers bundles of scope for 'l33t skillz.' as your aim and timing improves.

Armed with a Single-Barrelled Shotgun, Double-Barrelled Shotgun and the all-powerful Rocket Launcher, he's great at both close-up 'duelling', area clearing and providing long-range cover. His firearms are complimented by standard-issue Hand Grenades and the truly impressive nail bomb.
