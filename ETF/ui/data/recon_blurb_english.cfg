The reconnaissance class of ETF, the 'Recon' is by far the fastest guy around. Though his weapons are more annoying than destructive, his ability to disappear in to the distance, while scanning for enemies in advance with his Radar Scanner, more than make up for his lack of raw power.

Still, his weapons are nothing to be sniffed at. Both his Single-Barrelled Shotgun and his Nailgun are easily capable of bringing foe in poor health to their knees, while his Stun Grenades and Flashbangs make for the perfect escape.
