# ETF 2.0

This is an early upload of the ETF mod post 1.6 release with some experimental code added that was not part of any original release but was my testing purposes.

Notes:

* 64-bit is not supported (yet, code limitations need working around)
* macOS is not supported (never was)
* Some code is used from other trees like OpenJK q_math and such for convenience this may be replaced or reverted at some point.
* Compilation uses CMAKE, use mingw on windows to build for real. MSVC will probably produce incorrect results with movement.
* Some features I added are WIP and need removing
* Code is released under GPLv3 terms same as original ET per Splash Damage's request.
