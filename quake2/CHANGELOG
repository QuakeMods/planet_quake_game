- Default gl_texturemode to GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR (bilinear filtering).
- Fixed Anisotropic filtering (use glTexParameterf instead of glTexParameterv).
- Added multisample (FSAA) support for SDL refresh, use gl_multisample 1/2/4.

** While some might hastily call this a "cheat", I say it allows players to
use decent looking gl_modulate and intensity values while still seeing items
and other players.  People could just as easily set gl_modulate 10, but then
the whole game looks like ass.  For mods where having entities hiding in the
dark is critical, server admins can override the 'gl_minlight_entities' cvar.
