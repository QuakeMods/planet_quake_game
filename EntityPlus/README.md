# EntityPlus
EntityPlus is a mod that offers a true single player experience in the Quake III Arena videogame. The term "single player" here is used to describe an experience more akin to the single player games of Quake or Quake 2 than Quake 3's own single player bot matches. To facilitate this, EntityPlus implements a lot of features that are strictly aimed at single player gameplay.

News and information about new features will be reported to our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/#!/EntityPlus) as they are implemented. This offers a sneak peek into new features the next release of the mod will have.

## Latest News
* EntityPlus 1.1.7 has been released!
* Quake 3 mapper Martinus has released his map "Shipyard 17". The package contains a version for Team Arena as well as a version for EntityPlus. The gameplay is an arena boss battle type of thing where you'll be facing increasingly difficult opponents.

* Finally a new release of EntityPlus sees the light of day. The new release, version v1.1.3, is a relatively small update though, but it fixes some important issues, most notably the long standing invisible doors problem in deQer's "Carmack Fortress" map.
* Another quick release brings the mod up to version 1.1.2. It fixes some important scoring related issues and adds a new feature: the "wait" key for info_waypoint entities, which forces bots to wait for certain amount of time (or indefinitely) at a waypoint.
* Just released version 1.1.1 of the mod to fix a problem that occurs in deqer's "Carmack Fortress" map specifically. If you find yourself running into an invisible wall in a doorway right after defeating a bot then you'll need this update.

## Features

To view a complete list of features added to EntityPlus, download [the manual](https://github.com/TheEnginesOfCreation/EntityPlus/releases/download/1.1.7/manual-1.1.7.pdf). Additional information about each release can be found on the [EntityPlus wiki page](https://github.com/TheEnginesOfCreation/EntityPlus/blob/wiki/Index.md). 

## Example map
The release package of EntityPlus contains an example map which demonstrates a number of the features found in EntityPlus. It is based on an old classic map that everyone that played Quake 3 will instantly recognize. Don't get too comfy though, because this time you'll be fighting through piles of enemy guards to uncover a secret that you never knew was there and escape to safety. The map can be found in the single player menu.
