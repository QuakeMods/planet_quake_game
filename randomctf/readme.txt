Random ctf flag spawning
by blakjack

===========================================================

Create your maps with multiple ctf_blueflag and ctf_redflag entities, and one will spawn randomly on level begin and capture.

There are two test maps in the pk3 (simple box maps), ctftest with 10 flag ents and ctftest2 with 3.

One flag maps will still work with randomctf.

To get multiple flag maps to work with baseq3, give all but one flag of each colour the key/value pair "notq3a" "1". 

Similarly, to prevent items from spawning in randomctf, use "notrandomCTF" "1".

Future additions
-A REAL sample map?
