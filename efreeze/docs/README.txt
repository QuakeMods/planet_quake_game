The Story
---------

This mod was done due to community needs .. As players started to cheat and were using
different client side mods, community started to fall apart .. as we tried freezeDT for
anti cheat we got problems with compatibility on 1.31 .. it didn't worked well and lot's
of users were complaining .. as it was impossible to move community to 1.32 and as
some where satisfied with osp freeze, while others with normal insta freeze, the idea of
our own mod started .. Stema (and 333 clan) encourged me to start building new mod, while
p0isoN, Rebtor and Cheetos brought main ideas to the table .. also community started to 
contribute what would they like to have in mod and 95% of things are done in this mod .. 
as almost all european admins supported this project by running it on their servers, this 
mod is now a standard in european freeze communitry ..
