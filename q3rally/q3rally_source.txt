Introduction and Installation
-----------------------------

I have had a lot of requests for source code for my Maya md3Exporter since
I no longer have time to work on it.  I have included VC6.0 porject files which
should allow you to compile the dll versions of the mod.  I have also included the
batch files i use to compile qvms.  To compile the qvms with the batch files I
have included, you must have LCC installed.  You will also need to q3 mod source
code tools including q3asm.  If you dont use LCC it should be fairly simple to
change the batch files to point to your perfered compiler. You can download LCC
for free from this site: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/

I tried to keep all of my changes from the original source inside of // STONELANCE
and // END comments.  This should make it easier to track what code is for Q3R and
what code is original Q3A code, although there may be some new or modified code which
I forgot to wrap with my // STONELANCE comment.

The codein cg_atmospheric.c is based on the code by Q3F Development team, and is
modified by myself to include a few new features.  All modifications in this file
also be wrapped with // STONELANCE and // END comments.
