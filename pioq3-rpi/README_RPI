This is a port of Quake3 to run on BCM2835, based on the
ioq3 codebase. All BCM2835-specific modifications are enclosed by one of

RPIMODS_MISC - small miscellaneous changes
RPIMODS_OPENGLES - remove desktop GL dependencies
RPIMODS_DEPTH - remove depth buffer clears
RPIMODS_REPLACETRIG - replace sin with sinf etc
RPIMODS_NOSDL - remove SDL dependencies

There is a suitable prebuilt sdl lib in "lib".

Also you'll need to copy the pak files from a legitimate Quake 3 CD to q3/baseq3

Run:
./build-rpi.sh

to build. Tested with bcm2708-gcc toolchain from here:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools

cd q3
sudo LD_LIBARARY_PATH=<path to sdl lib> ./ioquake3.arm

to run

When I tried with the files from openarena (http://www.openarena.ws) it didn't work. 
It seems there's been some updates to the source since we branched. I'd imagine a merge with latest source may get this working.
