Version 1.0
=================================
New features:
* Alternative cell shading algorithm (white texture). You can try using the supplied shortcut or by running "quake3.cs +set r_celshadalgo 2".
* Rocket smoke trail and sprites like fonts do not have the cel shading contourn. That should make things easy to read and multiple rockets in a game won't bug the players.
* Sprites (such as buttons, and most text) are not been cel shaded. That should make text and buttons easier to read.

Bug fixes:
* Mirrors weren't working as expected, now it's fixed.
* Sky/depth bug fixed. This was very noticeable ;-)
* New Makefile. Should be easier to make under Linux.

New variables:
* r_celshadalgo Disable(0), Enable Kuwahara Filtering(1), Enable White Texture(2) for Cel Shading.
* r_celoutline Disable(0) or Enable(1) cell shading contourn.
