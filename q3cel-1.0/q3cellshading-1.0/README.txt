Instructions:
-------------
You need the retail Quake III Arena installed and patched to version 1.32.

NOTE: If, when loading a level, it takes a lot, please wait. Our texture filters can be slow sometimes :-)

Download the last version here http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=169901


* Mac OS X:
Unzip the maz .zip file and copy its content (two applications) to the Quake III Arena folder (usually it's "Applications:Quake III Arena"), the README and CHANGES files are not mandatory.

Run either "Quake3 Cell Shading" or "White Texture" to use one or other cel shading technique. White Texture will take longer to load the main screen game, please be patient (this only applies to Mac OS X due to how we run the game).

* Linux:
Extract the .tar.gz file, copy its content (a binary file and a bash script) to Quake III Arena folder (should be /usr/local/games/quake3), and run "quake3-cel.x86" or "quake3-cel.x86 +set r_celshadalgo 2" (White Texture algorithm).

* Windows:
If you downloaded the MSI package (recommended) just launch it, and it will install our engine in the Quake 3 Arena game folder (you need a valid installation) and create shortcuts on the desktop and the start menu (Cell Shading and White Texture). If you downloaded Windows binaries, you have to extract them and place them in the Quake 3 folder.

Enjoy. If you need any help, use the forums on the web page http://q3cellshading.sourceforge.net/
