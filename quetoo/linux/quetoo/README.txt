Quetoo BETA - http://quetoo.org

Thank you for downloading Quetoo BETA for Linux. In order to run the game,
you must first run ./bin/update.sh. This will retrieve game data and updated 
binaries from the official Quetoo release server.

The first time you run ./bin/update.sh, it may take several minutes. However,
on subsequent runs, it should be significantly faster, as only new or changed
content will be downloaded.

You should run ./bin/update.sh regularly, as the game is constantly being added
to and improved.

Once ./bin/update.sh completes, you may run ./bin/quetoo. You can also link
the .desktop items for Quetoo and Quetoo Update to the appropriate location(s)
for your distribution and desktop environment.
