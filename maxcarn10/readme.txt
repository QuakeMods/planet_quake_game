Maximum Carnage v1.0

I like to think of this little mod as having all of the weapons
turned up to 11.  Quake 3 turned up to 11, really.  Maybe I should
call it Quake 11 instead.  Anyway, here's a list of the modified
weapons.

Force Gauntlet
High-powered Machinegun
C4 Shotgun
Cluster Grenade Launcher
Homing Rocket Launcher
Scorching Plasma Gun
Chain Lightning Gun
Antimatter Railgun
Enhanced BFG10K (think Q2 BFG)

This mod has been playtested somewhat, but I just picked up the Q3
coding thing a couple of weeks ago and no doubt there are still
lingering issues.  Since this will probably be the only release,
I've included the source code to do with what you will.  I made
some use of the cluster grenade tutorial at QDeveLS
(http://www.planetquake.com/qdevels), so props to SumFuka for that.
I also got some tips on the Q3 code from Code3Arena
(http://www.planetquake.com/code3arena/).  No doubt I've forgotten
something else I should mention, but oh well.

I typically run the mod with the following command line:

quake3 +set fs_game MaxCarn +map q3dm12

Your mileage may vary.

Have fun, boys and girls.

Bugs:
The C4 Shotgun is not quite as powerful as it looks.  I was lazy
and used the grenade explosion instead of making a smaller one.

Suggestions for improvement:
Vulnerable rockets and grenades
Possibly start players with more health and/or ammo
