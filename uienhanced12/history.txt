The changes, updates, and bug fixes made to UI Enhanced


------------------------------
24 November 2002 - Version 1.2
------------------------------

  * Merged 1.32 source code changes. Includes some support for pre-1.32
    releases (notably 1.30, 1.31).

  * Added punkbuster support (sv_punkbuster and sv_strictAuth). Also added
    sv_lanForceRate server parameter. Only available when creating a 
    multiplayer (rather than a skirmish) game.

  * Added support for fractional bot skill in skirmish mode when a range
    of skill is specified.

  * Added fractional bot skill to in-game menus that add and remove bots.

  * Added a new bot selection method: the number of bots matches the size
    recommended by the map script, but bots are selected from a list 
    provided by the user.

  * Recognition of all demos compatible with the 1.32 release 
    (protocols 66, 67 and 68).

  * FIXED: initialization of the 1.27 or 1.17 mouse style in the control menu.

  * FIXED: two small GUI glitches in the bot skirmish menu.



------------------------------
29 November 2001 - Version 1.1
------------------------------

  * Item page of skirmish menu now uses a multi-tabbed control page as
    well. The old format (all items on a single page) is available through
    setting the cvar uie_olditemmenu to 1. Mods that add lots of items can
    now add to what was a crowded page.

  * Server page of skirmish menu now uses a multi-tabbed control page.
    Mods can now expand this page with their server options. 

  * Re-wrote preferences page to the same style as the controls
    multi-tabbed page. Added new weapon graphics options.

  * True resolution independent dynamic menus - and a more polished style.
    No more jaggedly aligned menu items at resolutions other than 640x480.

  * Start submenu is now sensitive to the game type, and join
    game/autojoin has become the first item on the menu.

  * Menu for voting yes/no is now sensitive to a vote in progress.

  * Callvote map selection now initializes to the current gametype.

  * Added core/ring colour selection for new rail effect.

  * Fixed a bug that prevented "team follow1" and "team follow2" from
    working.

  * Control setup now has a new tab for mouse/joystick input. Added a
    toggle for 1.17/1.27h mouse input preference.

  * New end credit sequence.

  * Pro-maps are recognized as being Id maps.

  * Removed code used to "fix" the fraglimit and timelimit bugs in single
    player games. Script option to prevent config bug is now disabled on
    fresh installation. These issues were fixed in the 1.30 release.

  * Merged fixedlegs and fixedtorso animation flags from client code into
    UI (problems with Magdalena model, among others).

  * Updated source code to 1.29h/1.30 release.

  * Moved skirmish cvars used by UIE into a separate data file
    uieSkirmish.dat. Full import in first run, so no values are lost. These
    values can then be manually removed from q3config.cfg (uie_ffa_*,
    uie_tourney_*, uie_team_*, uie_ctf_*).

  * Fixed a cvar that was incorrectly saved when a CTF script file was
    created (ui_ctf_timelimit).



--------------------------
27 June 2001 - Version 1.0
--------------------------

  * Source code release for developers

  * FIXED: Bot skill bias in skirmish menu caused a crash in the VM, but 
    not the DLL code.

  * FIXED: deleting a single map or bot cleared the entire list.
    Caused by a difference in memcpy() between the VM and binary builds.

  * FIXED: missing control on model animation page.


-----------------------
5 May 2001 - Beta 0.99a
-----------------------

  * Massive re-organisation of the skirmish code, separating the interface
    from the data and script generation. No visual difference, but makes
    porting to other Q3 games (TA, Voyager Elite Force) possible.

  * Choosing maps and bots is now even easier! Multiple selection and 
    text lists for big collections.

  * Software fix for the single player bot duplication and fraglimit bugs.

  * Skirmish bot selection has added the option to use bots
    recommended for the map, or a random selection of the same number of bots. 

  * Demo selection now finds demos by the appended protocol. Timedemo
    option also available.

  * Maps that don't have an arena script are now displayed when
    "all maps" is selected.

  * Model selection now includes rotation controls for better preview.

  * In game menu now defaults to a dynamic menu, and adds callvote, vote,
    setup commands etc. in a similar fashion to TA.

  * Skirmish maps can now be given their arena script recommended fraglimit.

  * Increased number of selected maps to 32 (from 24).

  * More skirmish server setup options.

  * More configuration parameters in Game Options.

  * All gametypes can now use the warmup interval.

  * Scripts are limited to 16K in size by an internal Q3 buffer. The problem 
    this presents to random map selections of about 25 maps or greater 
    have been eased.

  * User added maps are now sorted by map name. Id maps are given priority, 
    and will always appear first.

  * The FIGHT button in the skirmish mode is now disabled if no maps
    are selected.

  * Added swim animation to model selection and intro attract mode. 
    Unfortunately some models have "afflictions" (Doom, Klesk are particularly 
    bad) that suggest bad model anim data.

  * Included a fix for the Doom and Klesk swimming animation problems
    (zzz_animation_fix.pk3).

  * FIXED: single player maps that were unable to complete a single player tier
    (error message like: "1 arenas ignored to make count divisible by 4"),
    are no longer dropped from the map list. The map "halven" was one example 
    that created this error.

  * FIXED: bots changing every map when they should have been changing
    less frequently.

  * FIXED: Executing a UIE saved script with a data block caused unexpected 
    command execution on the console.

    The data format for saving map rotation setup data into script files has 
    changed. Data from previous versions can be loaded, but saved scripts cannot
    be loaded into previous versions of UIE.

  * FIXED: gaps appearing in the list of load/exec or save config files.

  * FIXED: Incorrect editing state when entering model selection with the
    team model viewed.

  * FIXED: item disable menu when called from the in-game menu now behaves 
    properly when ESC is pressed.

  * FIXED: Cursor tracking no longer gives torso movement during death animation.



--------------------------
1 January 2001 - Beta 0.99
--------------------------

  * Model chooser/animator now supports team models, as well as separate
    heads on models.

  * Support for item disabling, for both map rotation and in-game. The
    in-game disabling prepares for the next map, or a map restart.

  * Saved scripts for map rotations now include a parameter block for
    reloading at a later time. This parameter block includes all the
    variables used to set up the script, so you can start again or tweak
    again.

    Save several different starting positions for your own variation (a
    railgun tourney script and a small map tourney script, for example).
    Loaded from the server tab for Skirmish or Multi-player creation.

  * Re-enabled load and save config menus.

  * Small visual change to the in-game menu (press ESC) that clearly
    groups related menu commands together.

  * Added pmove_fixed and server smoothclient options to server tab.

  * REPLACED: All the uie_icons graphics have now been replaced by a
    single shader script file. Icon name usage is unchanged, but the
    original high quality Id graphics are used.

  * FIXED: Annoying torso move/snap when model changed in model picker, or
    by command line.

  * FIXED: Weapon change sound not playing during attract mode, or model
    animation.

  * FIXED: Team Arena menu in wrong position.


----------------------------
19 December 2000 - Beta 0.98
----------------------------

  * Ported to 1.27 source code


-----------------------------
19 December 2000 - Beta 0.97b
-----------------------------

  * Replacement icons for use with custom map identification, 
    and support for use of Id originals where higher quality
    versions are required.

  * Reduced memory overhead taken by VM as a memory pool

  * Map pics now loaded just before first use, not over all 
    maps in collection.

  * Commands issued on map start now use activeAction
    instead, previous delays should now disappear.


-----------------------------
16 December 2000 - Beta 0.97a
-----------------------------

  * New map grouping [NoBots]: for maps that don't include the 
    routing data used by bots.

  * Generated automatically from your map collection, you don't 
    need to add maps manually. 

  * Randomly generated maps now always exclude maps on the [NoBots] 
    list. You can still place these maps on your hand selected lists. 

  * Increased support for map arena scripts, about 1000 scripts can 
    now be loaded. 

  * BUGFIX: [No text] entries appearing on bot command menu under 
    certain circumstances. 


----------------------------
23 November 2000 - Beta 0.97
----------------------------

  * Model/skin selection page improved: models and skins are separated out.
    Also added an animation previewer: see how the model moves and sounds.

  * New bot command menu system, in the style of Unreal Tournament. Includes
    key binding in the setup menu, as well as an autoclose on/off in game
    options.

  * New type of map generation: "random, not list". Allows you to prevent
    certain maps from being used.

  * New type of map generation: "type bias". Allows you to use only Id,
    non-Id, or from both with bias. Custom maps types are also supported.

  * Map pictures now show info with a small icon: dm, tourney, team dm, ctf.
    The user can add new types to usermaps.txt, three additional types are
    already provided: railarena maps, small maps, big maps.

  * The map generation page allows you to create random lists of maps based
    on these map types. Play a random selection of RailArena maps!

    Statusbar text tells you how many maps are available for use.

  * The map selection page allows you to filter maps based on these custom
    user types, using the "type bias".

  * The map selection page now shows, in red, maps that've already been
    chosen.

  * New type of bot generation: "random, not list". Allows you to keep
    certain bots out of your generated bot rotations.

  * Map and bot generation pages show an identifying picture when the cursor
    hovers over an item on the list.

  * In-game add and remove bots menus now show a picture of the bot, as well
    as team and a skill icon, for easier identification.

  * Add bot menu now skips 7 bots at a time when using the scroll buttons.

  * In-game menu now shows a NEXT MAP option. Must be used in tourney
    rotations to move to the next map, but can also be used in any other
    gametype map rotation. Attempts to put player(s) directly back into the
    game when playing tourney.

  * Added model viewing to main entry page. Animated model follows
    cursor.

  * Animated model has an attract mode. Runs through movement, weapon
    change and fire, and death animations. Includes sfx (can be disabled).

  * BUGFIX: Some bots that used fun names weren't kicked when replaced with
    a new set (The Tick, Akuma[HPB], were two examples I found). Fixed.

  * BUGFIX: Escape key now behaves in the same way as the back button.

  * BUGFIX: Fixed an interface glitch that failed to hide some controls
    on the bot page.

  * BUGFIX: Maps with incorrect <b>scripts/mapname.arena</b> are now completely
    rejected. This includes .arena scripts that don't have an associated BSP
    map file. Previously an unknown map icon was displayed, with no map name
    or details.
